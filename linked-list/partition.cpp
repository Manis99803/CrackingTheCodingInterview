/*
    Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to X.
    If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the element less than x. The partition element X can appear anywhere in the 
    "right partition", it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
